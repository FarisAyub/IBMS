This project is an Insurance Broker Management System that allows customers to browse and select insurance policies from a variety of insurance organizations. Insurance brokers provide "policies" to users, each representing an insurance plan from a different organization. Customers can view these policies to compare options and choose the one that best fits their needs.

The system includes an admin panel where administrators can manage policies, user quotes, and account details. The platform serves as a connection between insurance organizations and customers, enabling users to register, log in, request quotes, or schedule appointments with brokers.

While several existing systems offer basic functionality for insurance brokerage, the aim of this project was to enhance usability and functionality by introducing advanced features. A key feature is the recommendation system that dynamically adjusts the content shown to users based on their preferences and behaviors. For instance, if a particular insurance policy gains popularity, it will be recommended to users who might be interested in similar options.
